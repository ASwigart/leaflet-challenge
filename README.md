Module 15 Assignment Repo

Hi, I'm sorry this is late. I wanted to get a layer to work that wasn't requested but I thought looked cool. I included a bathymetric layer to the map. Unfortunately
I can't the topo layer and a the bath layer to work together but if you select the basic map it is the bathymetric map and the topo layer worked with the plates and
earthquakes. I thought the underwater earthquakes were cool, and would look cooler if there were an underwater view.
